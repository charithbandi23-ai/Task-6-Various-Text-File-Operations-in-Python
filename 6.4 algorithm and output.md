6.4 Log File Monitoring


Scenario: A system logs file system events. Write a program to count the number of times the word ERROR appears.

Algorithm:

1. Open system.log in read mode.

2. Initialize counter to zero.

3. For each line, if "ERROR" appears in the line, increment counter.

4. Close the file.

5. Display total ERROR messages.

Sample File: system.log
INFO: System started successfully
WARNING: Low memory detected
ERROR: Disk not found
INFO: User logged in
ERROR: Connection failed

Code:
count = 0
with open("system.log", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        if "ERROR" in line:
            count += 1
print("Total ERROR messages:", count)
