6.1 Student Attendance System


Scenario: College maintains a file storing student names and attendance percentages. Write a program to read the file and display students whose attendance is less than 76%.

Algorithm:

1. Open the file attendance.txt in read mode.

2. For each line, split into student name and attendance percentage.

3. Convert attendance percentage into a number and if less than 76, display the student name.

4. Close the file.

Sample File: attendance.txt
John, 85
Alice, 72
David, 60
Emma, 90
Sophia, 68
Code:
with open("attendance.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        name, percent = line.strip().split(",")
        if float(percent) < 76:
            print(f"{name} has low attendance ({percent})")
