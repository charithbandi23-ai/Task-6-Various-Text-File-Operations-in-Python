101, Arun, 50000
102, Bharya, 60000
103, Chitra, 55000
104, Deepak, 45000
Code:
emp_id = input("Enter employee ID to update: ")
new_salary = input("Enter new salary: ")
lines = []
with open("salary.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        eid, name, sal = line.strip().split(",")
        if eid == emp_id:
            line = f"{eid},{name},{new_salary}
"
        lines.append(line)
with open("salary.txt", "w") as f:
    f.writelines(lines)
